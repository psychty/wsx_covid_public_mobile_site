#COVID-19 West Sussex Data Pack Supplement Analysis mobile friendly site

##This is the mobile device friendly version of the West Sussex C19 data pack

West Sussex County Council Public Health Department monitors COVID-19 related information on a daily basis, and a summary pack is published weekly as a powerpoint slide deck. Links are provided to public data sources available.

This data analysis is intended to supplement the published data pack by allowing a user to explore more detail in the charts such as finding out the number of cases in an area on a particular day by hovering over one of the bars or points. This website is updated more frequently than the weekly powerpoint file on the West Sussex County Council website, in order to show the very latest data available so note that the figures may be different.

Each time the website is updated a new powerpoint file is [available here]('https://github.com/psychty/wsx_covid_datapack_public/raw/master/Latest_West_Sussex_C19_slide_deck.pptx')

Local authorities currently have access to some information that is not in the public domain, which may be due to small numbers or due to data being provisional. The landscape of available data is changing all the time, and we hope to be able to publish as much as possible.</p>

For more information please contact [publichealth@westsussex.gov.uk]("mailto:publichealth@westsussex.gov.uk?subject=COVID-19")

All code is open; including an R script 'Public_mobile_data_pack_wsx.R' to compile and analyse new data, with data visualisation presented for web, using D3 javascript libraries. Some of it ~well~ annotated. These scripts can be amended to produce outputs for other areas. Please get in touch with us at Public

As more data becomes available, more will be added to the data visualisation.
