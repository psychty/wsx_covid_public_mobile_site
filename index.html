<h4>Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases</h4>
<p>The figure below shows the daily confirmed cases of Covid-19 over time in XXX. The black line represents the rolling average number of new cases confirmed in the previous seven days.</p>
<p>It can take several days for results to be reported and we consider the last four days as incomplete as more cases may be added to the totals for these days.</p>

<p>Figure</p>
<p>Viewing the cases per 100,000 allows you to compare across areas as if they had the same population size.</p>

<div class="body_content" id = 'hosp_section'>
<h4>Hospital activity</h4>
<p>This section includes what we know about the number of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 or catching the virus whilst in hospital as well as the number of COVID-19 positive patients currently occupying beds</p>
<p>Note, this data relates to the hospital trusts providiing care and does not necessarily reflect the residents of a particular area.</p>

<div class="body_content" id = 'mortality_section'>
<h4>Deaths</h4>
<p>The Office for National Statistics published weekly data on the number of deaths occurring each week in 2020 and whether or not COVID-19 was mentioned as an underlying or contributing factor to the death.</p>
<p>Note, this is not the same as mortality reporting on the government website which includes any deaths within 28 days of a positive test result.</p>
