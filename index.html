    <p>The number of new confirmed cases is now available at a very localised area (called Middle-layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs for short) covering communities of on average 7,000 people. This is useful as it means you can see what cases are like where you live or where your friends and family live. We do not get the same detail from the data published at this level compared to wider areas and when there are fewer than three cases in a seven day period in the MSOA, these are supressed.</p>
    <p>You can search for any postcode in England in the box below and more detail about cases in that local area will appear.</p>

    <!-- <p>MSOAs vary in the size of the geographical areas covered, but they are designed to cover roughly the same number of people (about 7,000 people).</p> -->
    <p>As some data are suppressed, where there have been very few cases in a 7 day period, it is not possible to calculate how many cases there have been in total in a local area. See <a  class = 'highlight_dl_link' href = 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/office-for-national-statistics-recommendation-for-publishing-data-at-small-geographies-for-nhs-test-and-trace/disclosure-risk-assessment-for-nhs-test-and-trace-counts-at-small-geographies'>Department of Health & Social care guidance</a> on supressing small counts.</p>
