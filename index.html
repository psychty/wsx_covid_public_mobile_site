        <p>Some areas have more older people and care homes and so these areas will likely show as having a higher proportion of people with vaccinations as these populations were prioritised to receive immunisation.</p>

        <p>This number of individuals receiving vaccinations excludes a small number of people who did not have their age recorded at the time of vaccination. As such it may be different to figures presented elsewhere.</p>
        <p id = 'se_eng_selected'></p>
        <p>This excludes a small number of individuals where age was unknown at the time of vaccination. Currently, those aged under 16 are not eligible for the vaccine and so this cohort has been removed from the denominator (the population at large) in calculating the proportion value for those receiving a COVID-19 vaccination overall.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class = 'local_section' id = 'local_section'>
  <div class="content">
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Cases in your local area</h4>
    <p>The number of new confirmed cases is now available at a very localised area (called Middle-layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs for short) covering communities of on average 7,000 people. This is useful as it means you can see what cases are like where you live or where your friends and family live. We do not get the same detail from the data published at this level compared to wider areas and when there are fewer than three cases in a seven day period in the MSOA, these are supressed.</p>
    <p>You can search for any postcode in England in the box below and more detail about cases in that local area will appear.</p>
    
    <div class='inputHolder'>
      <input placeholder='Postcode' type='text' id='txtPostcode'/>
      <input class = 'inputHolder_button' type='button' value='Search' id='btnPostcode'/>

      <p class = 'local_child' id = 'local_case_summary_3'></p>

      <p class = 'local_child' id = 'local_case_summary_5'></p>
      </div>

    <p>As some data are suppressed, where there have been very few cases in a 7 day period, it is not possible to calculate how many cases there have been in total in a local area. See <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/office-for-national-statistics-recommendation-for-publishing-data-at-small-geographies-for-nhs-test-and-trace/disclosure-risk-assessment-for-nhs-test-and-trace-counts-at-small-geographies'>Department of Health & Social care guidance</a> on supressing small counts.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that at a small area level (particularly at a local neighbourhood level such as MSOA) <b>figures can fluctuate considerably from day to day </b>and a small change in the number of cases (for example if a few large family groups test positive) this can have a big impact on the rates, so it is always worth considering not only your immediate area but the wider area when looking at the current situation and trends.</p>

    <!-- <p>Following a national lockdown in England between 5th November 2020 to 2nd December 2020 areas returned to a tiered system allocating each local authority across the country to one of three tiers with a review of each areas placement every 14 days. However, on Saturday 20th December, the UK Government announced a fourth tier (Stay at home) to try to limit the spread of rapidly rising rates of COVID-19.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>West Sussex has been placed in the highest tier (<b>Stay at home tier 4)</b> from the 26th December 2020. A full breakdown of the Tier 4 restrictions can be found on the <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tier-4-stay-at-home'>GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
    <p>The map below shows how restrictions vary across England. Tier 1 areas are shaded yellow, whilst Tier 2 areas are light blue, Tier 3 (very high) is dark blue and the highest tier (Tier 4 - stay at home) is purple. <b>As at 31st December 2020, all areas in England are in either Tier 3 or Tier 4.</b></p>
    <div id = 'ltla_restrictions_map'></div>
    <p>The map covers restrictions outlined by the UK government for England. Local authorities also have statutory powers to impose prohibitions or restrictions on premises, events and public spaces.</p> 
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Returning to schools in 2021</h4>
    <p>On the 30th December 2020, the Department for Education set out new guidance for schools and childcare settings. Its premise is to enable settings to prepare programmes for testing staff and pupils over the coming weeks using lateral flow device tests.</p>
    <p>To support this, the guidance indicates that in the week commencing 4th January 2021, secondary schools should only provide education on site to vulnerable children and children of critical workers whilst prioritising remote education to those pupils in exam years and where possible other pupils. The following week (commencing 11th January), remote education should be available to all pupils and all pupils should expect to return to on site education from the 18th January.</p>
    <p>Primary schools in some local authorities are also requested to restrict on site education to children of critical workers and vulnerable children with a review of restrictions by the 18th January 2021.</p>
    <p>The map below shows which areas (highlighted in red) will have primary schools remaining closed for all but vulnerable children and children of critical workers.</p>
    <div id = 'ltla_primary_schools_map'></div>
    <p>Early years settings should be available as normal from January 2021. Shielding advice is currently in place in tier 4 areas, and so all children still deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are advised not to attend school.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>On 22nd February 2021, the Prime Minister announced a plan called the 'roadmap out of lockdown' to begin easing the restrictions set out in the third national lockdown in England.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>Further information is available on the <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary'>GOV.UK website</a>.</p> -->
