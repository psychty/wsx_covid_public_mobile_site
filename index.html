    <p>The number of new confirmed cases is now available at a very localised area (called Middle-layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs for short) covering communities of on average 7,000 people. This is useful as it means you can see what cases are like where you live or where your friends and family live. We do not get the same detail from the data published at this level compared to wider areas and when there are fewer than three cases in a seven day period in the MSOA, these are supressed.</p>
    <p>You can search for any postcode in England in the box below and more detail about cases in that local area will appear.</p>

    <p>As some data are suppressed, where there have been very few cases in a 7 day period, it is not possible to calculate how many cases there have been in total in a local area.

    <h4 class = 'content_top'>COVID-19 restrictions</h4>
    <p>The UK Government announced a national lockdown for the whole of England between 5th November 2020 to 2nd December 2020 followed by a return to a tiered system allocating each upper tier local authority across the country to one of three tiers with a review of each areas placement every 14 days.</p>
    <p>West Sussex has been placed in the <b>High Alert tier</b> (Tier 2). A full breakdown of the Tier 2 restrictions can be found on the <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know#high-alert'>GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
    <p>The map below shows how restrictions vary across England. Tier 1 areas are shaded yellow, whilst Tier 2 areas are light blue and the highest tier (Tier 3) is dark blue.</p>
    <div id = 'utla_restrictions_map'></div>
    <p>The map covers restrictions outlined by the UK government for England. Local authorities also have statutory powers to issue "directions" which impose prohibitions or restrictions on premises, events and public spaces.</p>

    <p>This section includes what we know about the number of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 or catching the virus whilst in hospital as well as the number of COVID-19 positive patients currently occupying beds</p>
    <p>Note, this data relates to the hospital trusts providiing care and does not necessarily reflect the residents of a particular area.</p>

<section class="mortality_section" id = 'mortality_section'>
  <div class="content">
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Deaths</h4>
    <p>The Office for National Statistics published weekly data on the number of deaths occurring each week in 2020 and whether or not COVID-19 was mentioned as an underlying or contributing factor to the death. These data are published weekly by the ONS and there is a lag of 11 days because the data are based on death registrations.</p>
    <p>There is an alternative measure of COVID-19 mortality reported which is the number of deaths for people who have a positive COVID-19 test result. Whilst this is more up to date than the ONS data, it is not broken down by place of death and any death is included in the measure regardless of cause if it is within a certain number of days of a positive test result.</p>
