<!--  ! Test positivity - Could this be misleading to readers, what does a 10% figure over a 5% figure really mean and does it say anything about the infection spread.

<!-- <section class = 'positivity_section' id = 'positivity_section'>
  <div class="content">
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Number of tests and positivity rates</h4>
    <p>The majority of COVID-19 testing in the UK to date has been Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing which is lab-based and tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus (rather than testing for the body's immune response or antibodies). This data shows the number of people who received at least one PCR test in the previous 7 days, as well as the percentage of people who received a PCR test in the previous 7 days who had at least one positive PCR test result (the positivity rate). People are only counted once in a 7 day period.</p>
    <div class = 'figure_style' id = 'positivity_figure'></div>
    <p><b>It is important to consider test positivity with caution and alongside the other measures such as confirmed case numbers and the information available on those being tested.</b></p>
    <p>A higher percentage of positive tests could suggest higher transmission, and perhaps that there are likely more people with coronavirus in the community who have not been tested yet, which could indicate a need for conducting a higher number of tests. However, it could be that a change in positivity is related to different groups of people coming forward for testing.</></p>

  <div class="content">
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Cases in your local area</h4>
    <p>The number of new confirmed cases is now available at a very localised area (called Middle-layer Super Output Areas or MSOAs for short) covering communities of on average 7,000 people. This is useful as it means you can see what cases are like where you live or where your friends and family live. We do not get the same detail from the data published at this level compared to wider areas and when there are fewer than three cases in a seven day period in the MSOA, these are supressed.</p>

However, on Saturday 20th December, the UK Government announced a fourth tier (Stay at home) to try to limit the spread of rapidly rising rates of COVID-19.</p> -->
    <p>West Sussex has been placed in the highest tier (<b>Stay at home tier 4)</b> from the 26th December 2020. A full breakdown of the Tier 4 restrictions can be found on the <a href = 'https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tier-4-stay-at-home'>GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
    <p>The map below shows how restrictions vary across England. Tier 1 areas are shaded yellow, whilst Tier 2 areas are light blue, Tier 3 (very high) is dark blue and the highest tier (Tier 4 - stay at home) is purple. <b>As at 31st December 2020, all areas in England are in either Tier 3 or Tier 4.</b></p>
    <div id = 'ltla_restrictions_map'></div>
    <p>The map covers restrictions outlined by the UK government for England. Local authorities also have statutory powers to impose prohibitions or restrictions on premises, events and public spaces.</p> 
    <h4 class = 'content_top'>Returning to education in 2021</h4>
    <p>On the 30th December 2020, the Department for Education set out new guidance for schools and childcare settings. Its premise is to enable settings to prepare programmes for testing staff and pupils over the coming weeks using lateral flow device tests.</p>
    <p>To suppor this, the guidance indicates that in the week commencing 4th January 2021, secondary schools should only provide education on site to vulnerable children and children of critical workers whilst prioritising remote education to those pupils in exam years and where possible other pupils. The following week (commencing 11th January), remote education should be available to all pupils and all pupils should expect to return to on-site education from the 18th January.</p>
    <p>The guidance also set out a 'Contingency Framework' designed as a means of reducing transmission within settings and the wider community in areas of extremely high prevalence of COVID-19. Primary schools in some local authorities are requested to restrict on-site education to children of critical workers and vulnerable children with a review of restrictions by the 18th January 2021.</p>
    <p>The map below shows which areas (highlighted in red) will have primary schools remaining closed for all but vulnerable children and children of critical workers.</p>
    <div id = 'ltla_primary_schools_map'></div>
    <p>Early years settings should be available as normal from January 2021. Shielding advice is currently in place in tier 4 areas, and so all children still deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are advised not to attend school.</p>
